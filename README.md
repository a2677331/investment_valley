# Investment Valley
My CINF-405 Project: A PyGame-Based Game Designed to teach a player Financial Knowledge and Investment Skills.

## How to run the game:
- cd to  `investment_valley`  folder
- setup and activate Python Virtual Enviroment (Optional)
- make sure Pygame is installed, I used `pip3 install pygame` on my Mac
- type  `python3 code/game.py`  to run the game

## Need to be done:
- [ ] make graphs showing the price trend for stock, crypto, and real estate trading
- [ ] functions for bank

## What I did: 
  - [x] added background music 
  - [x] Initial running the game displays an intro screen, and subsequent runs will show the intro screen with the previous play's score
  - [x] added a money score in the top bar
  - [x] set a timer for 5 min for each round
  - [x] label each building with names "stock exchange", "casino"...
  - [x] player can move using arrow keys
  - [x] 5 buildings with collision detection, so player cannot move across each building
  - [x] player animations
  - [x] game map and building images
  - [x] player can buy/sell stocks, and real-estates
  - [x] functions for Casino, Lottery, Stock, Casino buildings
  - [x] player can "talk" to buildings
